# 100DaysOfNLP-DL_Code

My progress in my own challenge: "100 days of Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning code challenge". That means coding and/or studying Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days.

## Day 01 : Janaury 19 , 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : I learned word vectors using Gensim. Despite, I coded visualization of word embeddings. I follow the first assignment in the CS224N: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. 

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Natural Language Processing in a more effective way .

## Day 02 : Janaury 20 , 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : Assignment 01 - CS224N - Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

**Thoughts** : I worked with glove-twitter-25 database, and I don't use glove-twitter-25 database, because of hardware limitations.

## Day 03 : Janaury 27 , 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : Word Embedding with Deep Learning using Pytorch.

**Thoughts** : I read the tutorial Word Embeddings: Encoding Lexical Semantics of Pytorch.
 
**Link of Work:** [Commit - Basic Pytorch](https://github.com/marbramen/100DaysOfNLP-DL_Code/blob/master/Day%203%20-%20Basic%20PyTorch%20NLP%20DeepLearning.ipynb)
