# 100DaysOfNLP-DL_Code

My progress in my own challenge: "100 days of Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning code challenge". That means coding and/or studying Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days.

## Day 01 : Janaury 19 , 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : I learned word vectors using Gensim. Despite, I coded visualization of word embeddings. I follow the first assignment in the CS224N: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. 

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Natural Language Processing in a more effective way .
